## UC4Character Array Based Palindrome Validation

### Description
This Java application checks whether a given string is a palindrome using a character array and the two-pointer technique.

### How It Works
- Declares and initializes a string
- Converts the string into a character array
- Initializes two pointers:
    - `start` at the beginning
    - `end` at the last character
- Compares characters at both ends
- Moves pointers toward the center
- Stops if a mismatch is found
- Displays whether the string is a palindrome
